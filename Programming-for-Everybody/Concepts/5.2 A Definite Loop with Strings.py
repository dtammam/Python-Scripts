'''
A Definite Loop with Strings

    - This is the same as before, except now we're doing strings
    - We have 5 strings and we are using 'friend' as the iteration variable
    - You could use anything, this is just easier for us humans to read

friends = ['Preston', 'Alex K.', 'Alex M.', 'Mont', 'Ray', 'DeWitt']
for friend in friends :
    print("How's it goin, my buddy", friend)
print('Done!')
