Object Oriented Definitions and Terminology

    Object Oriented
        - A program is made up of many cooperating objects
        - Instead of being the "whole program", each object is a little "island" within the program and cooperatively working with other objects
        - A program is made up of one or more objects working together - objects make use of each other's capabilities

    Object
        - An Object is a bit of self-contained Code and Data
        - A key aspect of the Object approach is to break the problem into smaller understandable parts (divide and conquer)
        - Objects have boundaries that allow us to ignore un-needed detail
        - We have been using objects all along: String Objects, Integer Objects, Dictionary Objects, List Objectsâ€¦
        - Input -> Code/Data -> Output

    Definitions
        - Class - A template
        - Method or Message - A defined capability of a class
        - Field or attribute - A bit of data in a class
        - Object or Instance - A particular instance of a class

    Terminology: Class
        - Defines the abstract characteristics of a thing (object), including the thing's characteristics (its attributes, fields or properties) and the thing's behaviors (the things it can do, or methods, operations or features).
        - One might say that a class is a blueprint or factory that describes the nature of something.
        - For example, the class Dog would consist of traits shared by all dogs, such as breed and fur color (characteristics), and the ability to bark and sit (behaviors).

    Terminology: Instance
        - One can have an instance of a class or a particular object.
        - The instance is the actual object created at runtime.
        - In programmer jargon, the Lassie object is an instance of the Dog class.
        - The set of values of the attributes of a particular object is called its state.
        - The object consists of state and the behavior that's defined in the object's class.
        - Object and Instance are often used interchangeably.

    Terminology: Method
        - An object's abilities. 
        - In language, methods are verbs.
        - Lassie, being a Dog, has the ability to bark.
        - So, bark() is one of Lassie's methods.
        - She may have other methods as well, for example sit() or eat() or walk() or savetimmy().
        - Within the program, using a method usually affects only one particular object; all Dogs can bark, but you need only one particular dog to do the barking.
        - Method and Message are often used interchangeably.

# Some Python objects

# Creates an object
x = 'abc'
# Prints the class
print(type(x))

# Prints the class
print(type(2.5))
# Prints the class
print(type(2))

# Creates an object
y = list()
# Prints the class
print(type(y))

# Creates an object
z = dict()
# Prints the class
print(type(z))

# Prints the methods
print(dir(x))
# Prints the methods
print(dir(y))
# Prints the methods
print(dir(z))
