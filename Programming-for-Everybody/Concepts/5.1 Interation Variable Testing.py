Iteration Variable Testing

    - Below is a good example of an iteration variable
    - We set the variable as 3, then have the loop subtract to it until it is no longer meeting the original criteria
'''
n = 3

print("So, I'll need you to clap three times for me before I can let you out of this loop. Can you do that?")

while n > 0 :
    print('*Clap*')
    n = n - 1

print('Thanks for the claps, bub.')
