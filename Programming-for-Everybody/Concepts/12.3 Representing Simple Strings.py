'''
Representing Simple Strings

	- Each character is represented by a number between 0 and 256 stored in 8 bits of memory
	- We refer to "8 bits of memory as a "byte" of memory (i.e. my disk drive contains 3 terabytes of memory)
	- The ord() function tells us the numeric value of a simple ASCII character
